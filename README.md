# Installation
Spark Python API is used in code. To install PySpark run the following:

    pip install pyspark

All other libraries used in the code should be in Anaconda distribution of Python 3.8.
# Project Motivation
In today's dynamic world, we are seeing a growing number of large data, and manipulate these large data on personal computer can be a problem due to lack of memory. This is a perfect opportunity to experiment Spark, a big data analytics tool, on a dataset of music streaming application. Churn rate is what most service businesses pay attention to, and this project analyzes user behaviors in the music streaming app, Sparkify, and build machine learning models to predict churn. 
# Dataset
Dataset is user activity log, which includes user information, browser, account level, location, song, artist, and timestamp. 
# File Descriptions
One Jupyter notebook that includes code, plot and output related to exploratory data analysis and machine learning models. 
 # Statistical Models
 Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Linear Support Vector
 # Result
 Findings of this project was published on Medium available [here](https://edwinhung.medium.com/predicting-churn-rate-on-a-music-streaming-example-sparkify-325caea280e9).
